A: The author reflects on their college experience, describing it as a transformative period marked by a blend of independence and youthful folly.  Their dorm room, a chaotic yet comforting space, became the backdrop for late-night studies fueled by instant noodles and coffee, and impassioned debates that stretched into the early morning hours.
